        tabItem(tabName = "chatbot", fluidPage( # Voice Recognition Chatbot Content ))
      )
    )
  )
)
Part 2: Setting Up Required Accounts
With your development environment in place, the next step is to set up the necessary accounts and obtain API keys. To integrate advanced AI features into your chatbot, you will need an API key from Google Gemini Pro, a leading provider of advanced generative AI models. Create an account on Google Cloud Platform, navigate to the Gemini Pro section, and generate your API key. This key is crucial for authenticating requests from your Shiny application to the Gemini Pro API.

textInput("apikey", "Enter API Key", value = "YOUR_API_KEY")
Part 3: Creating the Career Recommendation Chatbot
Once you have your environment and accounts set up, you can begin developing the most basic version of your chatbot. Start by creating a simple Shiny application with a user interface that includes a text input field for users to enter their queries and a button to submit the input. The server logic within the Shiny app will process the user input and generate responses. Initially, you can implement a basic function that echoes the user’s input back to them, simulating a rudimentary interaction. This initial setup provides a solid foundation for integrating more advanced features later. Thoroughly test this basic version to ensure that the input and output functions are working correctly before adding more complex functionalities.

UI for Career Reccomendation Chatbot:
# Define UI
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Career Recommendation Chatbot"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      textInput("userInput", "Ask about your career:", placeholder = "Type a question..."),
      actionButton("sendBtn", "Send"),
      textInput("apikey", "API Key", "")
    ),
    mainPanel(
      dataTableOutput("chatOutput")  # Display chat history
    )
  )
)
Server Logic for Simple Echo Response:
 server <- function(input, output) {
  chat_history <- reactiveVal(data.frame(Role = character(), Message = character()))

  observeEvent(input$sendBtn, {
    user_input <- input$userInput
    chat_history(rbind(chat_history(), data.frame(Role = "User", Message = user_input)))

    response <- paste("You asked:", user_input)
    chat_history(rbind(chat_history(), data.frame(Role = "Bot", Message = response)))

    output$chatOutput <- renderDataTable(chat_history())
  })
}
This simple implementation echoes the user input, allowing you to test the basic functionality.

Part 4: Integrating Voice Recognition
To enhance the user experience, integrate voice recognition capabilities into your chatbot using JavaScript and the Web Speech API. This integration enables speech-to-text conversion, allowing users to interact with the chatbot via voice commands. In your Shiny application, add buttons to start and stop voice recording. The JavaScript code will handle the capture of audio input, convert it to text, and then send this text back to the Shiny server. You will need to set up event listeners in JavaScript to manage the start and stop actions, utilizing the Speech Recognition interface for processing the audio input. Ensure that your JavaScript is properly linked and executed within the Shiny app to handle these interactions seamlessly.

UI for Voice Recognition Chatbot:
tabItem(tabName = "chatbot",
  fluidRow(
    sidebarLayout(
      sidebarPanel(
        actionButton("start", "Start Recording", icon = icon("microphone"), class = "btn btn-success"),
        actionButton("stop", "Stop Recording", icon = icon("stop"), class = "btn btn-danger"),
        verbatimTextOutput("transcription"),
        textInput("userInput", "Type your message:", ""),
        actionButton("generateBtn", "Send", icon = icon("paper-plane"))
      ),
      mainPanel(
        dataTableOutput("chatOutput")
      )
    )
  )
)
Server Logic for Chatbot Responses:
observeEvent(input$generateBtn, {
  api_key <- input$apikey
  user_text <- input$userInput
  
  # Generate chatbot response (e.g., using an API)
  response <- generateContent(user_text, api_key)
  
  # Update chat history
  chat_history <- rbind(chat_history(), data.frame(Role = "User", Message = user_text))
  chat_history <- rbind(chat_history(), data.frame(Role = "Model", Message = response))
  
  output$chatOutput <- renderDataTable(chat_history, options = list(paging = FALSE, searching = FALSE))
  
  session$sendCustomMessage('speak', list(text = response))  # Read out the chatbot response
})
The user starts or stops voice recognition using buttons. The JavaScript code captures the spoken input and sends it to the Shiny server. The server processes the input using the GeminiPro API, generates a response, and updates the chat history. The response is also spoken aloud using the Speech Synthesis API.

Part 5: Integrating the Gemini Pro API
With the basic chatbot and voice recognition functionalities in place, you can now integrate the Google Gemini Pro API to provide advanced AI-generated responses. Develop a function in your Shiny server logic to send user inputs to the Gemini Pro API and retrieve the generated responses. Utilize the API key obtained earlier to authenticate these requests. Format the API responses for display in the Shiny application, allowing your chatbot to deliver more sophisticated and contextually relevant answers compared to the basic echo function. This integration will significantly enhance the chatbot’s capability to understand and respond to user queries with advanced AI-driven insights.

UI for GeminiPro Integration:
sidebarPanel(
  textInput("apikey", "API Key", ""),
  textAreaInput("userInput", "User Input", placeholder = "Enter text...", rows = 3),
  fileInput("imgInput", "Upload Image", accept = c('image/png', 'image/jpeg')),
  actionButton("generateBtn", "Generate Response"),
  actionButton("voiceBtn", "Start Voice Input")
)
Server Logic for API Calls:
observeEvent(input$generateBtn, {
  api_key <- input$apikey
  user_text <- input$userInput
  img_path <- if (!is.null(input$imgInput)) input$imgInput$datapath else NULL
  
  if (is.null(img_path)) {
    response <- generateContent(user_text, api_key)  # Text-based response
  } else {
    response <- generate_content_vision(user_text, img_path, api_key)  # Vision-based response
  }
  
  # Update chatbot history and read out response
  chat_history <- rbind(chat_history(), data.frame(Role = "User", Message = user_text))
  chat_history <- rbind(chat_history(), data.frame(Role = "Model", Message = response))
  
  output$chatOutput <- renderDataTable(chat_history, options = list(paging = FALSE, searching = FALSE))
  
  session$sendCustomMessage('speak', list(text = response))  # Speak the chatbot response
})

Part 6: Converting Audio to Text
To ensure smooth interaction between voice inputs and text-based responses, implement audio-to-text conversion using JavaScript’s Web Speech API. When users speak, the JavaScript code will capture their voice, transcribe it into text, and send this text to your Shiny application for processing. The server-side logic will then use the transcribed text as input for the Gemini Pro API. Proper handling of audio recording and text conversion is essential to ensure that your Shiny app can process and display the transcribed text effectively, facilitating seamless communication between voice and text inputs.

Using the Web Speech API, the chatbot can convert voice input to text and process it through the Gemini API.

Server Logic for Audio-to-Text:
observeEvent(input$voice_input, {
  user_query <- input$voice_input
  
  # Send transcribed voice input to Gemini Pro API
  response <- generate_content(user_query, api_key = input$apikey)
  
  chat_history(rbind(chat_history(), data.frame(Role = "User", Message = user_query)))
  chat_history(rbind(chat_history(), data.frame(Role = "Bot", Message = response)))
  
  output$chatOutput <- renderDataTable(chat_history())
})
This enables seamless interaction between voice and text-based input.


Part 7: Implementing Logistic Regression for Employment Predictions
To offer data-driven career advice, integrate logistic regression analysis into your chatbot for predicting employment probabilities based on user inputs. Create a dataset with features such as GPA and major, and use R’s glm function to fit a logistic regression model. This model will analyze how various factors influence employment outcomes and provide predictions based on user inputs. In your Shiny application, include an interface for users to enter their academic details and view predictions generated by the logistic regression model. This feature adds a layer of personalized career advice based on statistical analysis, helping users understand their employment prospects better.

Part 8: Adding Salary Prediction Features
To further enhance your chatbot’s capabilities, integrate a salary prediction feature. This involves creating a dataset with salary information relevant to different careers and degrees. Implement a predictive model to estimate salaries based on user inputs such as career path, years of experience, and degree level. In your Shiny application, provide an interface where users can select their career path and other pertinent details to receive salary predictions. Visualize the salary data using graphs to help users better understand potential earnings. This feature offers practical insights into career choices, complementing the personalized advice provided by the chatbot and assisting users in making informed career decisions.

By following these steps, you will create a comprehensive career recommendation chatbot that leverages voice recognition, advanced AI, and predictive modeling to offer personalized career guidance.

      textOutput("predicted_salary"),
      plotOutput("salary_plot")
    )
  )
)
Server Logic for Predicting Salary:
observeEvent(input$predict_salary, {
  req(input$salary_career, input$salary_experience, input$salary_degree)
  
  # Filter the salary data based on user input
  filtered_data <- salary_data %>%
    filter(Career == input$salary_career, Experience >= input$salary_experience, Degree == input$salary_degree)
  
  # Handle case with no matching data
  if (nrow(filtered_data) == 0) {
    output$predicted_salary <- renderText("No data available for the selected criteria.")
    return()
  }
  
  # Calculate predicted salary and display it
  predicted_salary <- filtered_data %>%
    summarise(Predicted_Salary = mean(Salary, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    pull(Predicted_Salary)
  
  output$predicted_salary <- renderText({
    paste("Predicted Salary: $", round(predicted_salary, 2))
  })
